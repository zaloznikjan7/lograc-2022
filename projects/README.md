# Student projects

Below are links to brief descriptions of course project topics. Some
of the links include multiple variants of the given project topic.

You can sign up to a project of your choice at the 
[Spletna Uƒçilnica course page](https://ucilnica.fmf.uni-lj.si/course/view.php?id=252).

Please try to organise yourselves into teams of two. Pairing up with
somebody from your weekly exercise class group is also a good
idea---then you can use the weekly 2hrs for working on the project.

We will send out more precise instructions and reading materials per
project topic once you have organised into groups and chosen
topics. In addition, there will be some introductory lectures in the
coming week(s) covering the basic ideas involved in these projects.

Of course, let the course organisers know if you have a topic in mind
you would like to formalise in Agda that is not among the ones we have
listed below.

## Skeleton GitHub repository for the student projets

In case it helps, we have created a
[skeleton GitHub repository](https://github.com/danelahman/lograc-project-2022)
that you can fork and clone. It comes with the appropriate versions of
the Agda standard library and the Agda categories library as git
submodules (so remember to use the `--recurse-submodules` option when
cloning your fork of the repository).

Of course, if you prefer, you are also free to set up your own GitHub
repository for the project.

## Project topics

* Logic

  - [Predicate logic](logics.md)

  - [Modal logic](logics.md)

  - [Temporal logic](logics.md)

  - [Hoare logic](hoare-logics.md)

* Programming languages

  - [Extensions of PLFA](plfa-extensions.md)

    Disclaimer: These are simpler project topics with more pre-made
    scaffolding (the PLFA book) than others. As such, to get a grade 
    10 with these projects you would need to do significant additional
    extensions to what is proposed in the project description.
