# Monadic lenses

This file contains a single project.

## Source material

Based on the article:

  Reflections on monadic lenses
  by Abou-Saleh, Cheney, Gibbons, McKinna, and Stevens
  ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02484.pdf))
  
## Goals of the project

* Formalise parts of the theory of monadic lenses:

  - asymmetric monadic lenses
    - naive approach
    - monadic put-lenses
    - monadic lenses

  - examples of assymetric monadic lenses

  - Monadic symmetric lenses
    - naive monadic symmetric lenses
    - entangled state monads
    - spans of monadic lenses
  
* Parts of the formalisation that involve category theory should be
  formalised using
  [Agda's categories library](https://github.com/agda/agda-categories).
